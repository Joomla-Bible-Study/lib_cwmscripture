Fixes scripture fields failing to load on Joomla 7.

On Joomla 7, the scripture reference fields stopped working: typing a book name no longer offered suggestions, the chapter and verse hints did not appear, and the Bible version selector lost its search filter. Browsers reported `Joomla is not defined` in the developer console. Joomla 5 and Joomla 6 were unaffected.

The cause was a missing declaration rather than a change in the scripture code. This library's JavaScript uses Joomla's own core script, but never told Joomla it needed that file loaded first. On Joomla 5 and 6 the core script happened to load first for other reasons, so the omission never showed. Joomla 7 does not load it in that order, so the scripture fields stopped before they could start.

This release declares the requirement properly, so the fields behave on Joomla 7 exactly as they do on Joomla 5 and 6. The scripture handling itself is unchanged.

No action is needed after updating. If you are on Joomla 7 and have been seeing empty or unresponsive scripture fields, they will work again once this update is installed and your browser cache is refreshed.
